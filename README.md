<!-- ABOUT -->
## About

A simple python script to make a periodic backup of a given folder. For practice purposes, the shutil module was avoided.


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

You may simply download the synch_folders.py file or clone the repo and follow the instructions below.



<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

To use the script you need only call the file with four arguments:
1) the path to the folder you wish to backup
2) the path to the backup folder (creates folder if none exists)
3) the file that logs the changes (creates file if none exists)
4) the interval for the iteration of the script - the default unit of time is seconds, but with the flag -u it may be read as minutes (-um), hours (-uh), or days (-ud)

See the [open issues](https://github.com/LCGhit/folder_synchronization/issues) for a full list of proposed features (and known issues).
